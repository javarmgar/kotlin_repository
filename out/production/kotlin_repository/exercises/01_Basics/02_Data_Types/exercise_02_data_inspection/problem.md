## Data Inspection

### Objective:

You are given different data types in Kotlin. Your task is to write a program that prompts the user to input a value. Based on the input's data type, your program should output the type of the data.

### Requirements:

1. Your program should support the following data types: `Int`, `Double`, and `String`.
2. The program should prompt the user with: "Please enter a value:"
3. After taking the input, the program should print: "The data type of [input] is [data type]."

### Example:

```plaintext
Please enter a value: 42
The data type of 42 is Int.
```

### Kotlin Topics Involved:
- Basic Input/Output
- Control Flow (when expressions)
- Data Types
- 
### Constraints:
- If the input does not match any of the expected data types (e.g., it's a very long number), you can output "Unknown data type".
