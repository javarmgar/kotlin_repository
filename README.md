# Kotlin Exercises

This repository contains exercises that I'm developing and solving to hone my Kotlin programming skills. Each exercise focuses on a specific Kotlin concept or feature, making it a great resource for those learning the language or looking to refresh their knowledge.

## Getting Started

To work on these exercises, you'll need:

- [Kotlin Programming Language](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or any Kotlin-supporting IDE of your choice.

## Structure

Each exercise resides in its own directory, providing a brief description of the task and, when completed, its solution. 

## Exercises

1. **Exercise Name** - Brief description of what the exercise focuses on.
   - [Task](link-to-task-readme)
